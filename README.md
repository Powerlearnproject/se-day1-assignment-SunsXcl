#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software Engineering is a process involving a systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to build, deliver, and maintain high quality software systems.

It is important for the creation and maintenance of software applications and systems in modern technology industry.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1. The development of programming languages like FORTRAN and COBOL.
2. Establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s.
3. The advent of structured programming in the 1970s.
4. The rise of agile software development methodologies in the 2000s.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

1. Requirement: Gather and understand user/utility needs and specifications.
2. Design: Describe the architecture and details according to specific user requirements, and relevant standards.
3. Implementation: Write code to build the software as specified.
4. Testing: Test code to ensure satisfactory functionality and standards compliance.
5. Deployment: Release developed software to user.
6. Maintenance: Provide support, updates and enhancements after software release.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall Vs Agile
Contrast: Sequential approach / Iterative and incremental approach.
Similarity: Both leverage on collaboration.
Appropriate Scenario: less flexibility required / more flexibility required.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer: Writes the code and implements to ensure satisfactory functionality.
Quality Assurance Engineer: Designs and executes tests to ensure satisfactory quality and standards compliance of software.
Project Manager: Oversees planning, execution and delivery of software development project.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDEs: provides comprehensive tools to streamline code writing, debugging and testing. An example is Visual Studio Code.
VCS: enables tracking of changes to source code. An example is GitHub.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

   Challenges:
1. Changing requirements: Can introduce scope creep and cause undesirable delays.
2. Tight deadlines: Provoking rushed development and resulting in sub-optimal software quality hence user experience.
3. Technical debts: Can lead to high maintenance costs.

   Strategies to overcome challenges:
1. Ensuring effective communication can minimize, even prevent such case of changing requirements.
2. Prioritizing tasks can improve task management in case of a shorter delivery timeline.
3. Agile software development method can significantly improve task completion and quality of work from each focus group.
4. Regular reassessment of project goals and timelines to ensure feasibility of development scope.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit testing: Testing individual components or modules.
Integration: Testing interaction between individual components or sub-systems.
System: Testing functionality of all components of an entire system as a whole.
Acceptance testing: Testing for satisfaction of user or utility requirements.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt Engineering is a technique of crafting clear and specific instructions or queries to obtain most relevant feedback from a chatbot, or other artificial intelligence model.
It is important to obtain more precise and relevant content from the vast possible replies available.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague prompt: ‘Teach me coding’
Improved prompt: ‘Teach me the best practice for writing HTML code to make a link open in new browser tab’.
